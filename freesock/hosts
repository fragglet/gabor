# This is a sample HOSTS file used by FSI
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to hostnames. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding IP name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally,  comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#

127.0.0.1       localhost
192.234.116.1   taurus

# IPX host addresses
