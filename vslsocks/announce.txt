Subject: [dossock] VSL interface unit for Pascal available

I've finally managed to create an interface unit for the Virtual Sockets
Library for DOS. (As I already mentioned in one of my previous mails: it's a
generic BSD-sockets compatible interface, which isn't a protocol stack
itself, but provides an easy way to use different protocol stacks - like
BWTCP, PC/TCP, Microsoft TCP/IP, Novell TCP/IP, Pathway, and even IPX/SPX
and WinSock -  from your DOS programs.)

The interface is freely available to anyone - just drop me a mail if you
want a copy of it!
